* ***public:*** is an **access modifier** and it allows for all the other code to access this class. If you do not explicitly apply the *public* keyword, then it would only be accessible within the assembly that defined it. This is because the implicit access modifier for a class is *internal*. 
    * *example:* *public class Person {}*
